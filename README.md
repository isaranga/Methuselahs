# Methuselahs
This is the final assignment I submitted as part of the course "Biological Computation" at the Open University of Israel.

This assignment consisted of implementing a genetic algorithm that would find the best "methuselah" in Game of Life. A [methuselah](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Methuselah) is a pattern that takes many generations to stabilize (oscillators such as blinkers, as well as gliders, do not count as methuselahs).
